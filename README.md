<img align="right" src="assets/img/logo.jpg" alt="logo">
A podcast publishing extension for the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

## tl;dr

You generate a static web site for your podcast on your own computer, test drive it and sync it to your web space.

So no Wordpress, PHP, Ruby other scripting language, database management system or any other dynamic component is needed on your server.
Thich increases security immensely.

Technically speaking, jekyll-octopod is a Jekyll plugin and a Ruby Gem. It
contains of scripts, templates, helpers and extensions to publish your
podcasts the cool text file lover's way.

If you are not afraid of the command line of your computer and text files are the
stuff to heat up your geeky little heart, jekyll-octopod may be worth a trial
to publish your podcasts.

The underlying assumptions of Octojekyll-octopodpod are that static content
should be delivered statically and text files are the perfect way to handle
podcast metadata. So jekyll-octopod makes it easy to generate and deploy a
website and feeds for your podcast out of one textfile and at least one audio
file per episode.

**Is this production ready?**

We use it in production, so we believe it is.
But it is very likely, that it still contains bugs. And there is no guarantee that behavior will change with the next update :-).

Hopefully you are brave enough to play with this cute little toy anyway.
