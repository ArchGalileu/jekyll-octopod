# Jekyll - Octopod

A Podcasting publishing extension for the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Prerequesites

The programming language Ruby and it's package manager Bundler.

Nice installation guides for the different operating systems can be found at
the [Rails Girls Website](http://guides.railsgirls.com/install). You can stop
right before installing Rails, because we do not depend on Ruby on Rails here.

You can check, if you succeeded, by entering
```
$ ruby -v
$ gem -v
```
at the command prompt. Both commands should return version greater or equal 2.0 .

## Installation

$ gem install jekyll
$ jekyll new name-of-my-podcast
$ cd name-of-my-podcast
```

Create file Gemfile with the contents:

```
source 'http://rubygems.org'
gem 'jekyll-octopod'
```

Install the dependencies and run the setup script via:

```
$ bundle install
$ octopod setup
```

Update the configuration settings in the configation file `_config.yaml` in the
application directory.
